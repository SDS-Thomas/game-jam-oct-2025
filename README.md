Project Structure

Assets

Prefabs
* These are reusable game objects. You can create new prefabs by dragging them from the editor into this folder

Scenes
* These are the levels. They can't be easily merged, so it's best if only 1 person is working on a particular level at a time

Scripts
* This is where all of the programming happens

Sprites
* Images to be used in the game
